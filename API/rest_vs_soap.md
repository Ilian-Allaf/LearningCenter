# SOAP VS REST

**Key Differences: SOAP vs. REST**
SOAP is a protocol, while REST is an architectural style. This creates significant differences in the behavior of SOAP and REST APIs.

## Design
SOAP APIs expose functions or operations, whereas REST APIs are data-driven. For example, in an application containing employee data that other applications can manipulate, the SOAP API of the application might expose a function called CreateEmployee. Creating an employee involves specifying the function name in the SOAP message when sending the request.

In contrast, the REST API of the application might expose a URL like /employees, and a POST request to this URL would create a new employee record.

## Flexibility
SOAP APIs are rigid and only allow XML messaging between applications. The application server also needs to maintain the state of each client, meaning it has to remember all previous requests when processing a new one.

REST APIs are more flexible, allowing applications to exchange data in plain text, HTML, XML, and JSON. REST is also stateless, meaning the REST API processes each new request independently of previous requests.

## Performance
SOAP messages are larger and more complex, which slows down their transmission and processing. This can increase page load times.

REST is faster and more efficient than SOAP due to the smaller size of REST messages. REST responses can also be cached, allowing the server to store frequently accessed data in a cache memory to further reduce page load times.

## Scalability
The SOAP protocol requires applications to store state between requests, increasing bandwidth and memory requirements. As a result, SOAP applications are costly and difficult to scale.

In contrast to SOAP, REST allows for a stateless, layered architecture that is more scalable. For example, the application server can forward the request to other servers or allow an intermediary (like a content delivery network) to handle it.

## Security
SOAP requires an additional layer of WS-Security to work with HTTPS. The WS-Security system uses extra header content to ensure that only the designated process specified in the server reads the content of the SOAP message. This approach adds communication overhead and negatively impacts performance.

REST supports HTTPS without additional costs.

## Reliability
SOAP integrates error-handling logic and offers greater reliability. In contrast, REST requires you to retry in case of communication failures, and its reliability is lower.

| Meaning | Simple Object Access Protocol            | Representational State Transfer          |
| What Is It? | SOAP is a communication protocol between applications | REST is an architectural style for designing communication interfaces. |
| Design | SOAP API exposes operations.             | REST API exposes data.                    |
| Transport Protocol | SOAP is independent and can work with any transport protocol. | REST works only with HTTPS. |
| Data Formats | SOAP only supports XML data exchange.  | REST supports XML, JSON, plain text, and HTML formats. |
| Performance | SOAP messages are larger, slowing down communication. | REST offers faster performance due to fewer messages and support for caching. |
| Scalability | SOAP is difficult to scale. The server retains state by storing all previous messages exchanged with a client. | REST is easy to scale. It is stateless, meaning each message is processed independently of previous messages. |
| Security | SOAP supports encryption with additional costs. | REST supports encryption without impacting performance. |
| Use Cases | SOAP is useful for existing applications and private APIs. | REST is useful for modern applications and public APIs. |
