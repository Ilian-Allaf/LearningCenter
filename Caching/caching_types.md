# Caching types

## Browser Cache:

- Stores limited data types like HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript scripts, Images, and other multimedia files.
- Files are heavier and take time to load – thus, stored in the computer.
- Controlled by the user’s browser.
- Serves web pages directly without processing from the server.

## Server Cache:

- Saves content, code, queries, and similar data on a server.
- Type of server-side caching.
- Controlled by the server.
- Administered by website owners without any input from end-users.
- Best for high-traffic websites that need to reduce server strain.

## Proxy Cache:

- Allows web services to share resources with multiple users
- Saves bandwidth and decreases the loading time
- It might help in more complex scenarios, such as handling dynamic or frequently-updated resources (but only when using geotargeted content where the country/region-specific content is stored separately).
