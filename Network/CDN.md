# CDN
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of geographically distributed servers designed to improve the performance and reliability of delivering digital content, such as web pages, images, videos, and other assets, to end-users. CDNs work by caching content on servers located closer to users, reducing the latency and load on origin servers. This results in faster loading times, improved website performance, and a more efficient distribution of internet traffic. CDNs are commonly used to enhance the speed and availability of websites and online services, especially for users located in different parts of the world.
