# Websocket

WebSockets are a protocol that allows bidirectional and full-duplex communication between a client and a server over a single TCP connection.

This means that both parties can send and receive data at any time, without waiting for requests or responses. WebSockets are ideal for scenarios that require low latency, high throughput, and persistent connections, such as chat applications, online games, and live streaming.
